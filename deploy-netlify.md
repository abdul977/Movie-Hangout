# ðŸš€ Deploy Movie Hangout to Netlify

## Step 1: Create Netlify Account
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up with your GitHub account
3. This will give you access to deploy directly from your GitHub repository

## Step 2: Connect Your Repository
1. In Netlify dashboard, click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
2. Choose "Deploy with GitHub"
3. Select your Movie Hangout repository
4. Configure build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `out`
   - **Node version**: `18`

## Step 3: Set Environment Variables
In Netlify dashboard â†’ Site settings â†’ Environment variables, add:
```
SITE_NAME=Movie Hangout
PUBLIC_DOMAIN=your-site-name.netlify.app
REDIS_URL=your-redis-url (if you have one)
DEFAULT_SRC=your-default-video-source
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Step 4: Deploy
1. Click "Deploy site"
2. Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site
3. You'll get a URL like `https://amazing-name-123456.netlify.app`

## Step 5: Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Go to Site settings â†’ Domain management
2. Add your custom domain
3. Netlify will handle SSL certificates automatically

## Step 6: Enable Functions
Your API routes are now converted to Netlify Functions and will work automatically!

## Socket.IO Solutions

### Option 1: Quick Deploy with Fallback Mode (Easiest)
1. Set environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_FALLBACK=true`
2. This disables real-time sync but keeps basic functionality
3. Users will need to refresh manually for updates

### Option 2: External Socket Server (Recommended)
1. Deploy the socket server to Railway/Render:
   - Upload `socket-server/` folder to a new repository
   - Deploy to Railway.app or Render.com
   - Get the deployment URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
2. Set environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=https://your-app.railway.app`
3. Set: `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_FALLBACK=false`

### Option 3: Use Pusher (Professional)
1. Sign up for Pusher.com (free tier available)
2. Get your app credentials
3. Replace Socket.IO with Pusher client
4. Update functions to use Pusher API

## Troubleshooting
- Check build logs if deployment fails
- Ensure all environment variables are set
- Functions logs are available in Netlify dashboard
- Test socket connection in browser console
